# CIT-Tirana-Bachelors-Thesis-Template
In this repo i have uploaded a LaTeX template for anyone who has to do a bachelor's thesis at the Canadian Institute of Technology in Tirana, Albania.

To compile use XeLaTeX and biber.

```bash
xelatex main.tex;
biber main;
```

Might need to do this a couple of times when adding references.
